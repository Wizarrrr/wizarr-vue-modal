# Getting started

Wizarr Vue Modal is a lightweight and simple library for working with modal windows in Vue3. It integrates deeply with Vue.js and allows you to create modals of any complexity.

## Installation
Npm is recommended for installing a package.
```shell
npm i wizarr-vue-modal
```

## Connection to page
To get started, we need to initialize modal windows, add a container in which our components will be displayed. We import the container from the library:
```vue
<template>
    // Your HTML
    <widget-container-modal />
</template>
<script>
    import {container} from "wizarr-vue-modal";

    export default {
        components: {WidgetContainerModal: container},
        name: "App"
    }
</script>
```
